      Welcome to my "Hire Me" page. If you've landed on this page, you've likely been linked to it by me, or you've delved into some serious detective work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently employed as a Staff Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo Bank</a>. During my tenure there, I've bounced around different projects and teams but lately have been focusing on building out our suite of Lending products. Some projects I've worked on in the past include: re-building our new app(s) in React Native with Expo, our new Design System, updating our dependencies to handle React v18, integrating <a href="https://statsig.com/">Statsig</a> as our new feature and experiment platform, lead the Web efforts and promoted <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/technotes/TN0032-sdui-basics/">server-driven UI</a> architectural pattern and integrated with Column Tax for <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/varo-rolls-free-tax-prep-120838379.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANmSeTGnVURdC1SN5lnuRdpNQYL6XnENjL2fV6YFW7w8L0QOeLm1oNhffFzEn42tuRL1C-5fvuDsDXHVlxux2bsAhYCs212Si9AQaWam0qxfhPCRLtItbVwesotZI2lYY5F3_H-M_Wr6YKQSd-JU6JuGuuuKRJnsHMY9xUAfk4Rh"> tax prep purposes</a>. My code typically gets shipped to production once a week. I primarily work with technologies such as: TypeScript, React, React Native (Expo), GraphQL with Apollo and React Testing Library with Jest on the frontend and Kotlin, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Node.js and gRPC on the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before my tenure at Varo, I held positions as a Senior Full-stack/Front-end Developer at <a href="https://www.tzero.com/">tZERO</a> and <a href="https://www.overstock.com/">Overstock.com</a>. In those roles, I spearheaded projects using technologies such as React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I primarily focus on the frontend and client-side code, I consider myself a well-rounded Engineer with the ability to work across the entire tech stack and do so independently. I spent most of my career working with web technologies but recently found out I really enjoy React Native and the mobile space. I have a strong love for the UI aspects of client-side Engineering and possess keen attention to detail, whether it pertains to design or code. This attention to detail is what I consider my "superpower."

    <p>
      My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Strategic Communication from the University of Utah, as well as an Associate of Science degree from Salt Lake Community College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some current technologies that interest me: TypeScript, React, React Native, Expo, Astro, NextJS, RemixJS, Bun, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui and Redix UI. Would love to work with these in my next role.

      Outside of work, I take pleasure in spending time outdoors with my dog, Arto, and my girlfriend, Jordan. I also have a passion for cycling and running. For more on that, check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/256235">Strava</a>.
