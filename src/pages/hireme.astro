      Welcome to my "Hire Me" page. If you've landed on this page, you've likely been linked to it by me, or you've delved into some serious detective work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently employed as a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo Bank</a>. I bounce around different projects and teams but lately have been focusing on building our new Design System, updating our dependencies to handle React v18, integrating <a href="https://statsig.com/">Statsig</a> as our new feature and experiment platform, lead the Web efforts and promoted <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/technotes/TN0032-sdui-basics/">server-driven UI</a> architectural pattern and helped build out our new onboarding experience. My code typically gets shipped to production once a week. I primarily work with technologies such as: TypeScript, React, GraphQL with Apollo and React Testing Library with Jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before my tenure at Varo, I held positions as a Senior Frontend Developer at <a href="https://www.tzero.com/">tZERO</a> and <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/">Overstock.com</a>. In those roles, I led teams and spearheaded projects using technologies such as React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I primarily focus on the frontend, I consider myself a well-rounded Web Engineer with the ability to work across the entire tech stack and do so independently. I have a strong love for the UI aspects of Web Engineering and possess keen attention to detail, whether it pertains to design or code. This attention to detail is what I consider my "superpower."
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communication from the University of Utah, as well as an Associate of Science degree from Salt Lake Community College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some current technologies that interest me: TypeScript, React, React Native, Astro, NextJS, RemixJS, Bun, shadcn/ui and Redix UI. Would love to work with these in my next role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I take pleasure in spending time outdoors with my dog, Arto, and my girlfriend, Jordan. I also have a passion for cycling and running. For more on that, check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/256235">Strava</a>.

      Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to further discussion. Cheers ðŸ¤™
