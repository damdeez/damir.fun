      I am currently a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo Bank</a>. I bounce around different projects and teams at Varo but lately have been focusing on building our new Design System, updating our dependencies to handle React v18, integrating <a href="https://statsig.com/">Statsig</a> as our new feature and experiment platform, and building a new onboarding experience. I primarily work with technologies such: TypeScript, React, and GraphQL with Apollo.
