              </h4>
              <h5>January 2020 - Present</h5>
              <li>
                - Currently working on our Lending products, focusing on new
                features and improvements in a push for profitability.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Previously worked across multiple projects and
                cross-functional teams, often at once.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Initially joined as a Senior Frontend Engineer and promoted to
                Staff Engineer in March 2024.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Key contributions:</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                - Helped with a complete rewrite of the Varo Bank app using
                React Native with Expo and TypeScript. This streamlined
                development workflows and sped up feature delivery by ~3×,
                reducing the need from 3–4 engineers per feature to just 1–2
                engineers.
              </li>
              <li>
                - During the first part of the rebuild, led the Design System
                2.0 initiative, built components from scratch using React Native
                primitives, Storybook, and Chromatic. Resulted in ~35 Engineers
                having a much more streamlined way to build features.
              </li>
              <li>
                - During the later part of the rebuild, led and mentored a team
                of 3-4 engineers and owned the rewrite of the settings page and
                related sub-pages in React Native and Expo. Stressed the
                importance of quality and well tested code and pushed for use of
                AI tools.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Previously, drove frontend architecture improvements,
                including a shift toward server-driven UI patterns. Partnered
                with backend teams to define GraphQL schema contracts, improving
                mobile feature delivery speed and reducing redundant app
                releases by ~20%.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Integrated Column Tax, a tax filing service. This led to ~20k
                customers filing taxes for the 2024 Tax year through the Varo
                app.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Spearheaded the rollout of Statsig as the experimentation
                platform for Web. Collaborated with Product and Data Science to
                implement over 10 controlled feature rollouts and A/B tests in
                the first month.
